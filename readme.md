# **🚀 Real-time Object Detection App 🚀**

A real-time object detection application built with Python, OpenCV, and YOLOv8, deployed using Streamlit. This app detects and tracks multiple objects directly from a live webcam feed, displaying bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores in real-time.

## **🌟 Key Features**

* **🖥️ Live Webcam Feed:** Processes video stream directly from your webcam in real-time.  
* **⚡ Fast & Accurate Detection:** Utilizes the power of the YOLOv8 model for high-performance object detection.  
* **🎯 Multi-Object Tracking:** Detects and follows various objects simultaneously within the frame.  
* **📊 Rich Visualizations:** Overlays bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores on the video feed.  
* **🎨 Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly and interactive web interface.

## **🚀 Getting Started**

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

* Python 3.8 or higher  
* An active webcam

### **Installation Guide**

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   git clone \[https://github.com/AryanChoudhary930-cmyk/Real-time-object-detection-app.git\](https://github.com/AryanChoudhary930-cmyk/Real-time-object-detection-app.git)  
   cd Real-time-object-detection-app

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:  
   It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.  
   \# Create virtual environment  
   python \-m venv venv

   \# Activate it  
   \# On Windows:  
   venv\\Scripts\\activate  
   \# On macOS/Linux:  
   source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Required Libraries:  
   Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:  
   streamlit  
   opencv-python  
   ultralytics

   Then, run this command in your terminal:  
   pip install \-r requirements.txt

## **▶️ How to Run**

1. Launch the Application:  
   Ensure your virtual environment is active and you are in the project directory.  
   streamlit run app.py

   *(Make sure your main Python file is named app.py or change the command accordingly.)*  
2. Access the App:  
   Open your web browser and go to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).
